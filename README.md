-  Hi, I’m Nicholas
-  I’m currently learning Software Engineering at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University
-  This GitHub is a place for me to show off some of the code I have written for various assignments and projects
-  These coding assignments are designed to show my knowledge of C/C++, Embedded Systems, Database Design, as well as other coding practices
-  I am in the process of setting up this site so my repositories are not yet complete, I am still learning to use GitHub.
-  Due to copyright rules, im unable to post the corresponding assignments for the code I have uplaoded here.
-  my Email is: CAPRIOTN@my.erau.edu
